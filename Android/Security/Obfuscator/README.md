# Obfuscator
## Python obfuscator, it's so simple right now that probably anyone who could program can break it easily, but it may improve in future.

### TODO

Let the user choose wich obfuscation he wish.

Add an code validator in own obfuscated code.

Add support in others languages(Java).

Add more codifications(rot47,base64crypto,hexadecimal,etc).

Create an option to obfuscate with password.

Fix the EditText scroll behaviour.
